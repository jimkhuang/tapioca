Deucalion Aviation 公告與華航A350租機交易

06 Nov 2023
Deucalion Aviation announces long-term lease of one 2019 Airbus A350-900
aircraft with China Airlines and sale of the aircraft with the lease attached

After running a comprehensive campaign for either the sale or the lease of
the aircraft, Deucalion was able to arrange a long-term lease with China
Airlines.  Delivery of the aircraft on-lease to China Airlines is scheduled
to occur in December 2023.

Concurrently with the lease, Deucalion arranged the sale of the aircraft to
an investor which will assume the leasing of the aircraft to China Airlines.

Jon Skirrow, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of
Deucalion, said.

We are extremely pleased to have concluded this transaction, which was
particularly complicated given many stakeholders and aspects of the deal
including the redelivery, new lease and sale, all being arranged at the same
time. From early on in this process it was clear the greatest outcome would
be achieved through the combined lease and sale of the aircraft, and we are
thrilled to have fulfilled our commitments to our clients and interested
stakeholders.

不太確定這是華航公告的第一架A359 租機交易之後續, 還是新的第二架A350租機?
後續再觀察一下.
