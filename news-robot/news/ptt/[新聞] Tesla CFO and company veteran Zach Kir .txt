原文內容：

Zach Kirkhorn, one of Elon Musk’s closest lieutenants at Tesla, has
stepped down unexpectedly as chief financial officer as the electric-car
maker grapples with cutting costs and defending its profit margins following
a spate of price cuts.

Zach Kirkhorn是Musk最資深的手下之一，非預期的情況下提出辭呈，當Tesla正在奮力

削減成本以保護降價後的利潤。

He was replaced in the top finance job on Friday by Vaibhav Taneja, who had
been chief accounting officer since 2019, the company said in an official
filing on Monday. It added that Kirkhorn would stay on until the end of the
year to help with the transition and thanked him for his “significant
contributions”.

CFO的位置將由Vaibhav接任，Vaibhav從2019年至今一直都是會計主管

而Kirkhorn將會繼續在公司內部待到年底以進行完整的交階，Tesla並感謝他的貢獻

The departure follows a rare period of stability in Tesla’s senior ranks,
which in the past have been through periods of rapid turnover. Kirkhorn, a
13-year Tesla finance veteran, took the reins as chief financial officer four
years ago and has since presided over a turnaround in the company’s
finances, with its annual free cash flow increasing from roughly break-even
when he took over to more than $7bn last year.

這次的離職是在Tesla穩定期罕見的情況，該公司曾經有過動盪時期，大量高級主管出走

Kirkhorn在Tesla任職財務相關工作13年，四年前被任命為CFO

在他接任後Tesla財務狀況大幅好轉，可動用現金流在去年也增加到70億鎂

Tesla’s shares have risen ten-fold since 2019 as it overcame production
problems with its Model 3 sedan and went on to deliver 1.3mn vehicles in 2022.

Tesla 2019年克服了Model 3的製造問題後，2022年交付了130萬輛車子

而股價至今已上漲了10倍

Tesla gave no indication that Kirkhorn would be stepping down when he spoke
alongside Musk on the company’s latest quarterly earnings call with Wall
Street less than three weeks ago. He said on the call that he was “
hyper-focused on near-term cost reduction” in an effort to free up capital
to invest, as Tesla prepares for its next wave of expansion with the
long-awaited launch of its Cybertruck and the development of a production
plant in Mexico.

三周前Kirkhorn在投資人會議上一起和Musk發表談話，但沒提到離職的事情

他在電話財報會議中表示將關注於短期的成本削減、Cybertruck和墨西哥工廠

Kirkhorn brought a close eye for operational detail to Tesla’s presentations
and earnings calls, helping to reassure investors that the company had
consigned its historic production struggles to the past. His soft-spoken
style and careful delivery were a counterpoint to Musk, often leaving him to
translate the latter’s off-the-cuff financial comments into a form that was
easier for Wall Street to understand.

他在會議中的內容關注於營運重點和細節，給投資人信心帶來穩定

他本身發言謹慎且輕聲細語

和他的老闆Musk有著強烈的對比 - Musk經常隨興用直白的方式評論

給華爾街帶來許多波瀾

When Musk revealed last month that Tesla would spend $1bn on its Dojo
supercomputer by the end of next year, for instance, Kirkhorn stepped in to
explain that “the numbers that he mentioned are between R&D spend and
capital spend” and that the company gave a three-year capital spending
forecast. He added that things were “moving quickly” and Tesla would “
continue to update our guidance” to reflect such costs.

例如Musk上個月說要明年底之前砸10億鎂建立Dojo超級電腦

Kirkhorn馬上出來解釋說這數字包含了R&D和資本支出，同時也給出了三年資本支出計畫

接著補充事情發展的十分迅速，會持續更新最新措施以反映給市場相對的成本規劃

Taneja joined Tesla with its controversial acquisition of SolarCity, Musk’s
solar power company, in 2017. Before Solar City he had spent 17 years at PwC
in India and the US.

新任CFO接棒者Taneja 2016年加入SolarCity，隔年該公司在爭議中被Tesla所併購

在2016年之前Taneja在印度和美國服務於PWC 17年



心得/評論：

以下開放特空特多論戰

特空: CFO都烙跑了，多多準備死到底

特多: 人家還會留下來交接到年底，就是正常的高層異動

聽說跟Musk工作真的很困難啦，當你滿手Tesla股票可以套現

確實直接實現財富自由去找個舒適一點的工作也是個選擇

他在CFO在位期間確實看的到整間公司的財務面有極大的改善

市場投資人普遍蠻喜歡這位CFO的，主要是他能把Musk的豪洨轉化成正常語言

在許多層面上，這是無法量化的技能之一XDDDD

有傳聞他會去接Paypal高層，不過也有聽說他過去幾個月其實一直在賣股票
